A collaboration with [Tom Gibson](https://sirtomgibson.com){:target="_blank"} and Esme Lawton to build a website
showcasing a map of photos taken around Glasgow, capturing urban habitation
seen from an outside perspective.

As it was a fairly simple one-page website, I enjoyed working
with simple tools to build a manageable codebase without
library bloat and style things from scratch for a homemade art feel.

Tools:
- <b>LeafletJS</b>
- Vanilla <b>Javascript/CSS/HTML</b>
- Image asset hosting and loading
- <b>Github Pages</b>
