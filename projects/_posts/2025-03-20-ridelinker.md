RideLinker spawned from a business idea from a gap in the market -
a price comparison app for ride services.


From there is went through iterations from mockups, prototypes,
development builds to getting published on the AppStore and tested by real 
users.

It was a great experience in getting to go from a conception of an idea
to a full usable product on the market.

It taught me a lot of modern mobile technologies and tools such as:
- <b>Figma</b> for prototyping initial layout ideas
- <b>React Native</b> for implementing a modern crossplatform app
- <b>Expo Go</b> for making testing, building and deploying the app simple
- <b>Google and Apple Map/Places APIs</b> for getting and displaying map and address data
- <b>Google Play & App Store</b> to beta test and upload the finished product
