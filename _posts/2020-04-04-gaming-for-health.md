<b>Gaming for Health</b> was my fourth year University Project that focused on engaging UI design and [Gamification](https://www.gamified.uk/user-types/gamification-mechanics-elements/)
to design a health app that promoted every day usage to get consistant results and track improvement.

Concepts derived from video games such as Health Bars, Achievements and Easter Eggs were researched for their effectiveness used in a health application
and deployed to create a fun and immersive product.

From a technical standpoint, this was also my first dive into native <b>Android</b> development and learning the concepts of ViewModels, DAOs, SQLite databases and much more.
This began my deep dive into learning more about native app development and creating many other mobile applications.
