A collaboration with [Tom Gibson](https://sirtomgibson.com){:target="_blank"} and Esme Lawton to build a website
showcasing a map of photos taken around Glasgow, capturing urban habitation
seen from an outside perspective.

As it was a fairly minimal website, I enjoyed working with basic tools by using vanilla html/js/css
to create a website with minimal dependencies, knowing how everything fit together without library bloat.
