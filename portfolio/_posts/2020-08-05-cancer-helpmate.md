This was a summer internship at the University of Strathclyde awarded to me by [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/) that would continue to build
on the research from my [4th Year Project](/posts/gaming-for-health/) into Gamification and designing accessible and engaging mobile applications, with a focus on Young Adults and children.

<b>Cancer Helpmate</b> contained a bunch of tools to help young adults in 
hospitals learn more about and cope with their condition.
This included games and activities as well as 
interactive trackers of their daily mood and diet using 
engaging UI design, interactive widgets and word tools to allow
a welcoming and fun-to-use interface. 

Technologies:
- <b>Android Native</b>
- <b>AndroidX</b>
- <b>Java</b>
- <b>SQLite</b>
- <b>Gamification</b>
- <b>Accessible Design</b>
