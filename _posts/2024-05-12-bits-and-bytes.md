This project was a nice dive into the past, by creating a simple Question/Answer terminal program
which quizzed players on different aspects of the exhibition, computers and life.

A simple script with basic if/else statements showed some levels of intelligence that
some visitors found interesting and comical. On the other hand it shows
just how far AI tools have come within the last few years to change how we interact
and think about machines.
