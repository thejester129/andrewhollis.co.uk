This was a summer internship at the University of Strathclyde awarded to me by [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/) that would continue to build
on the research from my [4th Year Project](posts/gaming-for-health/) into Gamification and designing engaging mobile applications, with a focus on Young Adults and children.
