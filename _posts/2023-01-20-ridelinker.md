RideLinker spawned from a business idea from a gap in the market -
a price comparison app for ride services.


From there is went through iterations from mockups, prototypes,
development builds to getting published on the AppStore and tested by real 
users.

It was a great experience in getting to go from a conception of an idea
to a full usable product on the market.

It taught me a lot of modern mobile technologies such as:
- <b>React Native</b>
- <b>Expo Go</b>
- <b>Google and Apple Map APIs</b>
- <b>Google Place & Location APIs<b>
- <b>Working with AppStore to upload a product</b>
